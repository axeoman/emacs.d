   C-h b           Describe all current key bindings
   C-h m           Describe the current mode
   C-h a           Apropos - search the help for a term

  C-x e’ or <f4>   execute the keyboard macro

* win-switch (C-x o)
   transient mode that aids window navigation
** direct navigation:
    i             select the window above the current window.
    k             select the window below the current window.
    j             select the window left of the current window.
    l             select the window right of the current window.

** cycling navigation
    o             cycles forward through the window list in the current frame.
    p             cycles backward through the window list in the current frame.
    SPACE         cycles among existing frames.

** exiting
    u / <Ret>     exit window switching mode.
    Any key not bound to a win-switch command exits window switching mode
    (like u does) and then executes the original function. Waiting idle for more
    than win-switch-idle-time will exit window switching mode (like u does)
    C-M-g         is an “emergency” exit

** resizing
    I             vertically enlarges the current window
    K             vertically shrinks the current window
    L             horizontally enlarges the current window
    J             horizontally shrinks the current window

** splitting and deleting windows
    h             splits the current window into two equal windows, one above
                  the other. (H is a visual mnemonic for the split.)
    ;             splits the current window into two equal windows, side by
                  side. (: is a visual mnemnoic for the split.)
    0             deletes the current window

* magit
   from: http://daemianmack.com/magit-cheatsheet.html
** Buffers
   M-x             magit-status            Magit's status buffer
                   The main entry point to Magit, and the context where the
                   commands described in this cheatsheet are meant to be
                   executed. Probably a good idea to bind magit-status
                   to a key.

  $                magit-process buffer    Behind-the-scenes
                   Displays the git command and its output.

  g                reload status buffer
                   Necessary to update an existing Magit status buffer after
                   saving a file in emacs, or after making changes to repo
                   outside of emacs.

** Section Visibility
  TAB              Toggle visibility of current section

  S-TAB            Toggle visibility of current section and its children

  1,2,3,4          Expand current section to the corresponding level of detail
                   - 1, 2, 3 or 4   e.g., 4 will show all detail for the current
                   section.

  M-1,2,3,4        Expand all sections to the corresponding level of detail
                   - 1, 2, 3 or 4   e.g., M-4 will show all detail for the
                   entire buffer.

** Untracked Files
  s                Add untracked file to staging area

  i                Add file to .gitignore

  C-u i            Prompt for file/directory to add to .gitignore

  I                Add file to .git/info/exclude instead of .gitignore

** Staging and Committing
  s                Stage current hunk
                   If point is in diff header, will stage all hunks belonging
                   to current diff. If a region is active, only lines in that
                   region will be staged. This is a distinct improvement on the
                   conventional 'git add -p', the splitting mechanics of which
                   are... 'imperfect'.

  u                Unstage current hunk
                   As with s command, only in reverse: diff headers and regions
                   provide a corresponding context to the unstage action.

  S                Stage all hunks

  U                Unstage all hunks

  k                Discard uncommitted changes   As with s command.

  c                Prepare for commit
                   Pops up magit-log-edit buffer. to allow you to enter your
                   commit message.

  C-c C-c          Execute commit
                   Actually triggers commit action. Fire this inside the magit
                   -log-edit commit message buffer. To postpone the commit for
                   later, just C-x b to a different buffer and come back to
                   this buffer when you're ready,

  C-c C-a          Make the next commit an amend

** History
  l                History
                   Shows terse history for repository.

  L                Verbose history

  C-u l            History segment
                   Will prompt for beginning and end points.

  RET              Inspect commit
                   Shows full information for commit and move point into the
                   new buffer.

  a                Stage current commit on your current branch
                   Useful to cherrypick changes while browsing an alternative
                   branch. Cherrypicked changes need to be committed manually.

  A                Commit current commit on your current branch
                   As with 'a', but will automatically commit changes when
                   there aren't any conflicts.

  C-w              Copy sha1 of current commit into kill ring

  =                Show differences between current and marked commits

  ..               Mark current commit

  .                Unmark current commit if marked

  C-u ..           Unmark marked commit from anywhere

** Reflogs
  h                Browse reflog from HEAD
                   Reflog buffer works just like History buffer described above.

  H                Browse reflog from chosen point

** Diffing
  d                Show changes between working tree and HEAD

  D                Show changes between two arbitrary revisions

  a                Apply current changes to working tree
                   Change-selection works as described in 'Staging and
                   Committing' above.

  v                Apply current changes to working tree in reverse

** Tagging
  t                Make lightweight tag

  T                Prepare annotated tag
                   Launches magit-log-edit buffer for writing annotation.

  C-c C-c          Commit annotated tag
                   Actually triggers annotated tag action.

** Resetting
  x                Reset your current head to chosen revision
                   No changes will be made to working tree or staging area.
                   Typing x while point is in a line describing a commit will
                   offer this commit as the default revision to reset to.

  X                Reset working tree and staging area to most recent
                   committed state
                   Destructive! Will discard all local modifications.

** Stashing
  z                Create new stash
                   Stashes are listed in the status buffer.

  Z                Create new stash and maintain state
                   Leaves current changes in working tree and staging area.

  RET              View stash

  a                Apply stash

  A                Pop stash

  k                Drop stash

** Branching
  b                Switch to different branch
                   Current branch is indicated in header of status buffer.

  B                Create and switch to new branch

** Wazzup
  w                Show summary of how other branches relate to current branch

  i                Toggle ignore branch

  C-u w            Show all branches including ignored ones

** Merging
  m                Initiate manual merge
                   Applies all changes to working area and index, without
                   committing.

  M                Initiate automatic merge
                   Applies all changes to working area and index. Commits
                   changes immediately.

** Rebasing
  R                Initiate or continue a rebase

** Rewriting
  r s              Start a rewrite

  v                Revert a given commit

  r t              Remove bookkeeping information from buffer

  r a              Abort rewriting

  r f              Finish rewriting
                   Applies all unused commits.

  r *              Toggle the * mark on a pending commit

  r ..             Toggle the . mark on a pending commit

** Pushing and Pulling
  P                git push
